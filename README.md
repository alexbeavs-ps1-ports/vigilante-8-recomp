Static recompilation of **Vigilante 8** built on
[psxrecomp](https://github.com/Alexbeav/psxrecomp) and
[recomp-ui](https://github.com/mstan/recomp-ui).

A native recompilation setup host for Vigilante 8.

## RetComM Launcher

You can run this title **standalone** (release zip + the built-in recomp-ui
Generate & Build flow), or manage installs, updates, ROM/BIOS wiring, and queued
builds more intuitively with
**[RetComM Launcher](https://github.com/TechnicallyComputers/RetComM-Launcher)** —
the Retro Compilation Manager hub for self-compiling recomps.

RetComM checks for updates, rebuilds with existing build data when possible,
uses the same platform build tools as per-title launchers, and automates
BIOS/ROM/save plumbing so you are not stuck repeating each game’s wizard by hand.

## Legal

You must own the original game and provide your own supported disc image.
Disc images under `disc/` are ignored by Git and must never be committed.
Retail BIOS files are not redistributed. The Windows setup host collects the
required local inputs and builds the game on the user's computer.

## Quick start (dev)

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./psxrecomp/tools/ci/build_emitters.sh
python3 psxrecomp/psxrecomp_cli.py generate \
  --config game.toml --project-root . --disc disc/<your>.cue
cmake -S . -B build-release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-release --target psx-runtime
```

Zip prefix for CI artifacts: `Vigilante-8-Recomp`.

## Symbols

Progressive map: `symbols.toml` → `python3 tools/sync_symbols.py` →
`psx_symbols.h` (`PSX_FN_*`). See `psxrecomp/docs/SYMBOLS.md`.

## Framework pins

Submodule gitlinks (`psxrecomp`, optional `recomp-ui`, nested `recomp-net`)
are authoritative. `framework_pins.txt` is an optional scaffold snapshot;
release CI logs SHAs with `record_pins.sh` but builds whatever the gitlinks
resolve to. Bump submodules deliberately — do not float on `main`/`master`
in release CI.

## Platform support

Release 0.3.0 supports Windows x64. Linux and macOS remain in the workflow,
but their release jobs are deferred under the Wave 2 Windows-first exception.

## Corrected setup relaunch

Public `v0.3.0` can request the wrong executable after the first local build.
The `v0.3.4` source uses `Vigilante_8_Recompiled` in CMake, the setup relaunch, and the packager.

Release `v0.3.4` accepts the canonical 13-file Redump layout. It verifies the
first data track instead of the old merged whole-disc BIN. The old merged dump
identity remains accepted for compatibility.
The source parity gate passes. Exact-ZIP automatic relaunch remains a release gate.
## License boundary

Portfolio-owned source, scripts, configuration, and documentation use
GPL-3.0-only. The `LICENSE` file contains the complete terms.

PSXRecomp keeps PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0. Recomp-UI keeps MIT. The GPL
does not cover retail content, generated retail code, artwork, trademarks, or
these separately licensed dependencies.

## About this project

These ports are developed by a hobbyist (a DevSecOps engineer, not a game
programmer) with substantial AI assistance. What keeps that honest: every
change is validated before it ships - boot gates, hardware-oracle A/B
comparisons (Beetle/DuckStation), deterministic replay probes, and a shared
findings registry that documents failures as carefully as successes. AI
writes most of the code; the evidence discipline decides what survives.
Bug reports welcome - expect them to be investigated the same way.

tl;dr AI writes the code, but I always test it myself before pushing

## v0.3.5 three-platform candidate

The next release targets Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS Apple Silicon ARM64,
and macOS Intel x64. These packages remain candidates until the exact archives
pass the required native setup, startup, responsiveness, and clean-exit gates.
